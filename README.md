# FYP-Prototype
A very simple recommendation system using IF-ELSE, hard code from scratch. My first time coding in python. 

The recommend function is based on the decision tree model output. The model output has an 85% accuracy. 

The GUI was developed using tkinter GUI toolkit with the help of another app. The app is called Tkinter-designer by ParthJadhav, also found on Github.

I suppose, fellow reader/programmer, if you do have any suggestions to this repo, do let me know.
