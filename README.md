# FYP-Prototype
A very simple recommendation system using IF-ELSE, hard code from scratch based from the decision tree model I have generated. 
The model output has an 85% accuracy. 

Other than that, there is alot of limitations to this prototype. It mainly being a prototype. 
But the hard-code creates:

    Inflexibility: Hard coding the prediction function makes it difficult to change or modify the function without changing the code itself. This can be a problem if you want to make improvements to the function or if you want to use the system for a different purpose.

    Lack of adaptability: A hard-coded prediction function may not be able to adapt to new data or changing conditions. This can lead to poor performance over time as the system becomes less accurate.

    Difficulty in debugging: If there is an issue with the prediction function, it can be difficult to identify the problem and fix it if the function is hard-coded.

    Maintenance: Hard-coding the prediction function can make it difficult to maintain the system over time, as any changes or updates to the function will require changes to the code. This can be time-consuming and costly.

The GUI was developed using tkinter GUI toolkit with the help of another app. The app is called Tkinter-designer by ParthJadhav, also found on Github.

I suppose, fellow reader/programmer, if you do have any suggestions to this repo, do let me know.
